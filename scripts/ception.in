VALID SYMBOLS: S A B C _ 1 0 | . L R H X
# the tape has mandatory syntax and acts as a configfile.
# there are three customizable states denoted by A, B and C
# three tape symbols denoted by 0, 1 and _ (BLANK)
# and three possible movements denoted by L (LEFT), R (RIGHT) and H (HALT)
# tape always starts with S (the Start position)
# followed by transfer codings in REVERSE ORDER (MOVE, WRITE, TO, FROM, IF)
# transfer configs are separated by . (DOT)
# transfer configs are ended by | (PIPE)
# PIPE is followed by initial state and then the input tape itself
#TAPE: S R 0 A A 1 . R 1 A A 0 | A 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0
# this tape encodes the program FLIP
TAPE: S R 1 A A 1 . L _ C B 1 . R _ B A _ . L 1 A C _ . R _ B B _ | A 1 _ 1 1 _ _ 1 _ _ _ 1 1
# this other tape encodes the program CONCATENATE
